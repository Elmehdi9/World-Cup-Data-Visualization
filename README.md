* Used different statistical approaches and other data processing and data visualization techniques to analyze player or teams performances through various sorts of events; passes, carries, shoots, defensive actions, and so on, using statsbomb free event data, specifically World Cup 2022 event data.
* Preprocessed and extracted aggregated data (metrics) of player's performance throughout the whoel comptition and profiled these players.

## Plots
#### [Carries](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Portofolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Classification/Sensor-activity-recognition)

* Ball carrying distribution by player.
* A player's carries that ended in the opponent's half.
* Calculated the truer progressing carrier and plotted all of their carries.
